The server codenamed WaterBottle. Also called "Good old days".

When you're fishing in Minecraft, sometimes you'll get a bottle of water instead of a fish.  
That was the origin of the name. You'll need us, but you don't really need us,  
or you can even craft your own.

**Goal:**
- Create a gamer-centric experience.
- No unlimited system-shop.
- Everything you can get in vanilla is all available. No TNT or lava are blocked.
- No teleportation or warp point, but free fast-travel between "stations" via an end dragon ride.
